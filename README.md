My entry for the [16 Colour Jam!](https://itch.io/jam/16-colour-jam)

The best description I have for it is Downwell meets Hue. It's a platformer
where you have to use your ability to dye the world different colors to help you
deal with the enemies.

It was made in 2 days (with less than 10 hours development time total), so it's
very very rough. Regardless hope you enjoy!

Instructions:

Arrow Keys or WASD to Move

Space Bar to jump and dye the world!
